Resources for the Final Project
===============================

As part of a community of artists, you have a responsibility to
your fellow community mwmbers to help them think more broadly about 
their work.  For *every other project*, identify a work (preferably 
something written in Processing) that will better inform the project
and post a link to that work in the discussion for the project proposal.
