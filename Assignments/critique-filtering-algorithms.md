Critique: Filtering Algorithms
==============================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique *five* of your peers' explanations of filtering algorithms
from exercise 6.1.2.  (There are more critiques than normal this
time.  You can make them shorter than three minutes.  You can also
consider doing this critiques in writing, rather than as videos.)

In your critiques, you should consider whether the algorithm is expressed
clearly and whether the algorithm is likely to achieve the intended result.
You might also consider whether you would be able to turn the algorithm into
Processing code.
