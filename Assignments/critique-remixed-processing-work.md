Critique
========

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' "remixes" from assignment 2.1.3.  

In your critiques, you should consider not only whether the artist
has created something that seems "new", but also whether they have
achieved the goals that they set out for themselves and whether
they sufficiently described what they changed.

*Note: This assignment is intended, in part, to get you used to the normal
make/critique/respond rhythm of the course.*
