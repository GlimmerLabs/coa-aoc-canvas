Critique: Population Growth
===========================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' population growth projects.

In your critiques, you should focus primarily on whether the artist has
successfully used their work to achieve their stated goals.  I will be
asking each of you to revise your work, so please make sure to provide
good suggestions for revision.

You should also comment a bit on the code.  The primary criteria I will
use for their code are the clarity of the code and the efficiency of the
code.
