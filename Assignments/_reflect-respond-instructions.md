About Reflect and Respond
=========================

_This is a *Reflect and Respond* assignment.  You have now received
critiques of your assignment.  It's time to reflect on those
critiques.  Read, watch, and/or listen to each of the critiques.
Then, write a single response to those critiques and post it to the
discussion (preferably, as a followup to the critiques or your work)._

_Your response should acknowledge the suggestions and comments your
colleagues have made.  In some cases, you may note that a suggestion
is helpful and that you would rework your piece in a different way.
In others, you may find that a suggestion is inappropriate, and you
should respond by indicating why you consider that suggestion
inappropriate.  You should also do your best to synthesize the
critiques; don't respond to individuals, but to the collection of
comments._

_I tend to grade these assignments on thoughtfully you reflect on the
comments provided by your peers._
