Make: Analog Work

^_make-instructions.html^

1. Pick *two* of the algorithms (sets of instructions) posted by
your colleagues in response to assignment 1.1.5.  (Try to pick
algorithms that do not yet have responses.)  These algorithms should
describe how to make an image using colored pens/pencils and paper.

2. Follow the instructions to the best of your ability.

3. Post a photograph of each drawing as a followup to the post with the
instructions.

4. When there are two photographs associated with an algorithm, post
a picture of the original artwork.
