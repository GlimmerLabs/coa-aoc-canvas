Critique: Computational Reproduction
====================================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' computational reproductions from assignment 
5.4.1.

In your critiques, you should explore whether the reproduction is
"successful" (whatever that means to you), whether the variations
help illuminate important characteristics of the original work, and
whether the artists' reflections provide sufficient context.
