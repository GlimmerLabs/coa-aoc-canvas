Draft Final Project
===================

Create and post (to the Project Proposal Discussion) a working
"rough draft" of your final project.  You need not implement all
the aspects you intended for the project, but you should have 
something that shows significant progress.

In addition to your rough draft, post a short statement about what
other work you intend to do en route to the final version of the
project.
