Computationally Reproduce
=========================

^_make-instructions.html^

In assignment 5.3.1, you chose a work to reproduce computationally.  In
this assignment, you will write a program that not only reproduces the work,
but also creates variants of the work (e.g., by changing position, color,
size).

Add the following followups to your original post about the work.

1. Your reproduction.

2. At least four variants that you think have similar qualities as the
original.

3. The Processing code for your reproduction (and variants).

4. A short (two or three paragraph) explanation of what you learned about
the original work as you built your program.
