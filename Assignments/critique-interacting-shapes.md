Critique: Interacting Shapes
============================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' "interacting shapes" projects from assignment 
3.2.2.

In your critiques, you should consider not only whether the artist has
achieved something interesting in their work, but also the "quality" of
their code.  (For now, you can decide what makes code good or bad.)
