Critique: Project Proposals
===========================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' project proposals.

In your critiques, you should consider whether the work is achievable in
the amount of time allocated to the project (two weeks).  Other than making
sure that the project is achievable, you should suggest possible directions
the student might go in the project.  *Help your peers think more broadly!*
