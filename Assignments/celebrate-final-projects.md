Celebrate Final Projects
========================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Okay, this isn't really a critique.  You've spent a semester working on
learning a new medium, and you've spent two weeks working on a final
project.  Rather than critiqueing, we should be celebrating.

Pick three final projects with the fewest comments and record a
celebratory commentary video for each.  You should certainly discuss
aspects of the project in your video, but you should also free to
introduce other modes of celebration (in good taste).
