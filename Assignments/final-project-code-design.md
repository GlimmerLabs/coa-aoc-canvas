Final Project: Code Design
==========================

Before sitting down to code your final project, you should think about
what code you'll need to write.  Post a followup to your project proposal
in which you discuss the following:

1. What objects will your program keep track of.  In particular,
what characteristics do you plan to associate with each object?  For
example, you might have a bunch of rectangles, and for each rectangle
you will store width, height, center, primary color, and border color.

2. What do you plan to have happen at each iteration of the `draw()` procedure?
For example, you might move each rectangle a little bit.

3. What other functions will you need to write?  For example, you might need
to write functions that draw the rectangles, that determine whether two
rectangles overlap, and that update the rectangles in some systematic way.
