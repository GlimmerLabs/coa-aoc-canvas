Reflections on Algorithms
=========================

_This is a *One-Off* assignment.  It doesn't follow the patterns of the
more regular tpes of assignments in the course._

---

You have now seen two attempts to follow your instructions, as well
as your own two attempts to follow someone else's instructions.  (You
also have access to more algorithms and attempts.)

Reflect on the success (or lack thereof) of the various algorithms and
then post a followup message under your algorithm that indicates what
you did well and what you could have improved in your algorithm.
