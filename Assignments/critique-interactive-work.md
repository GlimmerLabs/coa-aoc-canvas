Critique: Interactive Work
==========================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' interactive works froma  recent 
assignment.

In your critiques, you should consider not only whether the artist
has achieved something interesting in their work, but also the role
interactivity plays in the work.  For example, is the interaction 
central to the work, or does it seem like an add on?
