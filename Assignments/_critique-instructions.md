About Critiques
===============

_This is a **Critique** assignment.  In a more traditional studio class, 
we would gather around each of your works and your peers would comment
on what they saw in your work and, we would hope, would suggest something
that would make you a stronger artist._

_Since we are working online, we will do our critiques electronically.
For three of your colleagues, do a short (approximately three minute)
video critique of the work.  You can use the Canvas video capture tool
or you can try something fancier (e.g., so that we can see the portions
of the work you are commenting on).  Post your critique as a followup
to the discussion message in which your peer did the work._

_Please pick three of the works with the fewest critiques, so that each
work will get approxiamtely three critiques._

_Your primary goal in the critique is to help your colleague do better
work.  That means that you should both point out things that are successful
and point to things that might be improved._

_I would suggest that you use something like a "sandwich critique" form.
Begin by saying something positive about the work.  Add comments about the
things that might be improved or considered in other ways.  Finally, end by
saying something else positive or encouraging about the work._

_I tend to grade these assignments on how seriously you've taken your job
and how well you focus on the particular issues from the critique assignment._
