Critique: Open Projects (Week Four)
===================================

^_critique-instructions.html^

Critique three of your peers' open projects from assignment 
4.2.2.

In your critiques, you should consider not only whether the artist has
achieved something interesting in their work, but also the "quality" of
their code.  (You can continue to use your own criteria for code quality.)
