Respond: Project Proposals
==========================

^_reflect-respond-instructions.html^

Your peers have provided some suggestions (suggestions that I hope are
useful) about your project.  Reflect upon and respond to the comments your 
peers and I have provided about your project proposal.  Your responses 
should include notes on things you plan to incorporate and explanations
of why you are ignore some of the "helpful" suggestions.
