Portfolios
==========

Using Canvas's *Portfolio* tool, create a selected and annotated compilation 
of your work from this semester.  Your compilation must include the following.

1. An artwork that you made that you consider artistically successful.

2. A statement about the work that describes what you were trying to
achieve, why you selected this work, and what you learned in making
this work.
  
3. An artwork that you made this semester that contains program code that
you are proud of.

4. A statement about the work that describes what you were trying to
achieve, why you selected this work, and what you learned in making
this work.

5. Two video critiques, one from early in the semester and one from late
in the semester.

6. A short analysis of how your critiques evolved over the semester.

7. A one-page essay in which you reconsider one or more of the ownership
issues we explored this semester.

8. A self assessment of how much progress you made on the GOA Core
   Competencies and the Course Competencies.  (A few sentences for each
