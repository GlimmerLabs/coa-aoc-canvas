Encapsulating Information with Objects
======================================

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

As you've written more programs, you've started to see that you often
want to "group" various values together.  For example, in your interacting
shapes project, you likely had a position, a size, and a color for each of
the shapes.  In Processing, as in many languages, the particular mechanism
we use to group values is called an "Object".  Objects also have some other
advantages, which we'll explain in this module.  We will also explore some
related issues.
