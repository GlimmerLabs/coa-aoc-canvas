Arrays and Repetition
=====================

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

As our programs grow in complexity, we find that we often need to
keep track of many things, and do similar processes with each thing.
For example, we might want to move from two to twenty interacting
objects.  To simplify the processing of multiple things, Processing,
like most programming languages, includes arrays, a mechanism for
grouping things, and repetition commands, which allow us to process
multiple things step by step.  In this two-week module, we explore
uses of arrays and repetition.

Primary competencies for this module

  adapting algorithms and programs.
* *Course: Algorithmic Analysis*.  You analyze and understand artistic
  works computationally.
