Arrays and Repetition
=====================

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

As our programs grow in complexity, we find that we often need to
keep track of many things, and do similar processes with each thing.
For example, we might want to move from two to twenty interacting
objects.  To simplify the processing of multiple things, Processing,
like most programming languages, includes arrays, a mechanism for
grouping things, and repetition commands, which allow us to process
multiple things step by step.  In this two-week module, we explore
uses of arrays and repetition.  We also apply some of this knowledge
to the reproduction of an existing work.

Primary competencies for this module
------------------------------------

* *Core: Reflection*.  You reflect on and take responsibility for your
  learning and that of others in an open forum.
* *Core: Independence*.  You organize your time and tasks to become
  an independent learner.
* *Course: Creative Coding*.  You create artistic works by writing and
  adapting algorithms and programs.
* *Course: Algorithmic Analysis*.  You analyze and understand artistic
  works computationally.
* *Course: Computational Thinking*.  You apply principles of computational
  thinking.
* *Course: Digital Ethics*.  You develop a personal ethics of reuse and 
  apply it to your work in the course.
