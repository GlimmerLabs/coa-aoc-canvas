Making Choices
==============

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

In writing programs, we often have to make choices.  For example, if we
are animating a bouncing ball, and we reach an edge, we often want it to
bounce.  Hence, in our program, we need to be able to ask "Is the ball at
an edge?" and make different decisions depending on whether or not the
ball has reached the dge.  In this module, we will explore the power of
decision making.
