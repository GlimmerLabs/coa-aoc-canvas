About Assignments
=================

Work is due at 10 p.m. (your local time) on the following dates.  *Don't
forget that the sketchbook assignment requires posting over multiple days!*

Sam and Sarah will be available for help on our Slack channel!  You
should also feel free to help each other.

You may also find it useful to look at the [Modules](../modules)
section or the [Syllabus](../assignments/syllabus) for other views
of the work due.
