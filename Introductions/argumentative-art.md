Introduction
============

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

While all art has a purpose, many works of art are intended to make
a form of argument, to convince the viewer of some some perspective
or to help the viewer think more deeply about an issue.  Some such
works might be considered "only infographics", but because they
still involve thought and creativity, I deem it reasonable to
consider them artworks.  This week, we will consider and make
argumentative works that draw upon data.
