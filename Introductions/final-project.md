Final Project (Two Weeks)
=========================

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

We're in the home stretch.  And so it's time for you to stretch your
creative muscles.  You will spend these two weeks of the course working
on a project of your own design.  (Yes, the project has to be in Processing.)
You can draw upon any resources you deem appropriate, including other works
from which you appropriate (code, images, etc.).

Yes, you still have to post daily sketches during the final project.  Your
sketches may certainly relate to the final project, but you may also find 
yourself exploring other ideas along the way.
