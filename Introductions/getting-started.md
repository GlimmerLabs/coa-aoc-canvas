Getting Started
===============

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

As you've probably noted, we're going to try to do a lot in this
course: build programming skills, apply these to making and
understanding art, critique each others' work, and more.  In this
first week of the course, you will be exploring some of the core
issues through a series of (comparatively) small assignments.  These
assignments will also help you get used to the standard kinds of work
in the class.

*Don't panic!*  While there are a lot of assignments, you can do it, and
we'll help you get through it.
