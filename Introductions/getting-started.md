Good evening students. (Or good morning, or good day, depending on 
when you view this video,) I very much appreciate the verve with which
you approached the orientation exercises. From the discussions in the
Connections board, it looks like we'll have a very interesting class.

You may have just noted that the words I'm saying in this video are
echoed below. I believe firmly that things I put on the Web should
be accessible, and audio is not accessible to the auditorially impaired.
Hence, you'll generally see me make things available in multiple forms.
(When I'm more energetic, I'll caption my videos.)  So why am I making
a video at all?  The folks at GOA tell me it's friendlier. I'm not sure
why you want to see my talking head, but GOA knows best.

Okay, back to the introduction ...

As you've probably seen, we're going to try to do a lot in this
course: build programming skills, apply these sills to making and
understanding art, critique each others' work, and more. In this
first week of the course, you will be exploring some of the core
issues through a series of (comparatively) small assignments. I
have you doing some reading, some exploring, and, starting Wednesday,
some coding. These assignments will also help you get used to the
standard kinds of work in the class.

Some of you have asked what you should do in the sketchbook before we
start working with Processing. I'm happy if you write a short note 
about something interesting you've found (something beyond what you've
done for the other assignments), or if you literally sketch an idea and
take a photo, or anything like that.

*Don't panic!* While there are a lot of assignments, you can do it, and
Sarah and I will help you get through it.

Wow!  I hate seeing myself on video.  I should probably trim my beard
a bit.  And the bifocals always make me look up.  Oh well.
