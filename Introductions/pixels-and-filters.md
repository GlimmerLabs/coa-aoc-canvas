Introduction: Pixels and Filters
================================

_Warning!  This is officially Grinnell College's Fall break (a week before
the GOA fall break).  Sam and Sarah may be less available.  Students can
choose to do the work this week or next week (but please let me know what
you choose).  Due dates are set for the second week._

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

We have been considering images primarily through the use of somewhat
coarse-grained tools: Shapes, lines, curves, etc.  In the digital realm
(well, in some digital realms), we also have access to more fine-grained
information.  As you likely know, each image is typically broken up into
a bunch of small colored dots called pixels.  This week, we will explore
issues pertaining to pixels, particularly mechanisms for transforming
the image based on its pixels (what is typically called "filtering").
