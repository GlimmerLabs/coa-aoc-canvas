Interactivity
=============

[Video forthcoming, generally released the first day of the module]

In most traditional media, the viewer responds to the work.  Art elicits
questions, ideas, feelings, and more.  As you saw in the introductory video,
digital work can also respond to the viewer.  In more advanced works, one might
use various kinds of sensors.  For this course, we will focus on somewhat
simpler interactive works, works that respond to mouse movements or key
presses (or both).  This week, we will explore the reation of such works.
