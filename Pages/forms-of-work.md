Forms of Work
=============

As you will see as you look through the course, we have a normal rhythm
of work in the course, along with a few basic forms of work.

Standard Module Structure
-------------------------

* Throughout the week, you will post sketches and respond to those
  sketches in the weekly discussion board.  (Don't do these all on
  one day; you are supposed to spread them throughout the week.)
* We have a first phase of work that is due on Wednesday.
  Often, this first phase lays the groundwork for the second phase.
* We have a second phase of work that is due on Sunday.
  Typically, this is a more involved piece of work that builds upon
  the practice and concepts from the first phase.
* We have a third phase of work that is typically due on Tuesday,
  with a possible followup.  This phase usually overlaps with the 
  first phase of the next module.  In the third phase, you will often 
  comment on or critique your colleagues' work.  You will then respond
  to those comments and critiques.

Primary Kinds of Work
---------------------

* In *Sketchbook* assignments, you will make sketches related to the ideas
  in the course and post short responses to your colleagues' work.  As
  noted above, you should plan on sketching and responding daily.
* In *Read, Reflect, Respond* assignments (and *Watch, Reflect, Respond*)
  assignments, you will read (or watch) something, reflect on some key
  ideas (often with guidance from a prompt), post your reflections, and
  respond to your colleagues' posts.
* In *Find, Comment, Respond* assignments, you will look for a particular
  kind of work, comment on it (again, with guidance from a
  prompt), and respond to your colleagues' comments.
* In *Find and Analyze* assigments, you will also look for a kind of work,
  but instead of a high-level comment,  you will provide some kind of
  analysis of the work.
* In *Try* assignments, you will experiment with programs (with some
  guidance) and write your own.  Each try assignment introduces one or
  more new concepts.
* In *Make* assignments, you will use the ideas or skills we have been
  developing to create a new work.  (In some cases, you will be permitted
  or even required to base your work on a previous work.)
* In *Critique* assignments, you will post a critique of your colleagues'
  work.  Critiques should be constructive.  In general, you should plan
  to make video responses to your colleagues' work.
* In *Reflect and Synthesize* assignments, you will reflect upon your
  colleagues' critiques and post a short note summarizing what you took
  from those critiques.
* In *Revise* assignments, which are always preceded by reflect and
  synthesize assignments, you will revise a previous work to incorporate
  the issues raised in the critiques and reflection.
