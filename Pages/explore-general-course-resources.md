Explore the General Course Resources
====================================

_Hmmm ... this is a GOA template page, but it seems to be empty.  I guess
I'm supposed to put some content here. -- SamR_

Our goal in this course is to help you thrive: to develop skills in
learning, art making, and computational thinking.  To support you in
these goals, GOA, Sam, and Sarah have provided (and will provide) you
with a wide variety of resources.

For now, you can explore the starting resources provided by GOA by
clicking on the "Modules" tab at the left and looking under
**General Course Resources**.

When, during this semester, you discover that you need a resource that
we have not yet provided, let me know, and I'll work to make it available.
For now, have fun exploring.
