How to Install Processing
=========================

We'll be using Processing as the primary programming platform for
the projects in this course.  (Damn!  I couldn't find a p-word for
"course"; "program" seemed inappropriate.) Hence, it is important
that you be able to run Processing on your computer and elsewhere.
So, let's look at how you get it installed.

The primary version of Processing is the desktop version, and it
runs on all three main operating systems (Mac OS X, Microsoft
Windows, and most flavors of Linux).  You can download Processing
at <https://processing.org/download/?processing>.  Once you've
download Processing, you'll probably have a file with a suffix of
`.zip`.  Double click on that file.  You should end up with an
application called **Processing**.  Double click on that file.
You'll probably get a warning about using software downloaded from
the Interweb.  Ignore the warning, and Processing should start.

It is also possible to do Processing on the Web, and we'll often
post our sketches to the Web.  Unfortunately, the desktop version
of Processing is 3.2.1 (as of the start of the course) and, as far
as I can tell, all Web versions of Processing use a prior version
of Processing (Procession 2.x).  At times, we may have to make
modifications to our code to get them to work on the Web.  *Ask
Sarah or me for help if you can't get a sketch to work online.*

Why do we need a Web version of Processing?  It's a nice way to share
your work with others.  There's actually some support for collaborative
programming online.  And, for the times that you can't access your
own computer, it's a good place to try some quick sketches.

For this course, we'll use Studio Sketchpad, available at
<http://studio.sketchpad.cc/>.  Please go to that site and create
an account.  If you'd like, you can also play with their sample
program.

Once you have downloaded Processing and set up an account on
Studio Sketchpad, you're ready to move onward.
