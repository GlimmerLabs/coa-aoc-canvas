Course Syllabus/Outline and Policies
====================================

_Welcome once more to The Code of Art, The Art of Code.   (Yes, I keep
rearrning the name.)  Let's go over some basic information._

Approximate Schedule
--------------------

This course is broken up into eleven core modules, plus the introductory
module and the resources module.  You can see all modules in the
**Modules** label on the left.  

* __1 Getting Started__ (one week, starts 2016-09-04): 
  For the first week of the course, we
  will be exploring applications of computing to digital art, looking at
  ways computing can be used to explore art, and finding out about the
  power of Processing, the language we use for this course.
* __2 Getting Started with Processing__ (one week, starts 2016-09-11):
  For the second week of the course, we will start writing and
  remixing programs written in Processing.  We will also consider some
  related issues.
* __3 Making Choices__ (one week, starts 2016-09-18):
  For the third week of the course, we explore conditional operations
  in Processing.  Conditional operations let you choose different things
  to do depending on certain conditions.
* __4 Encapsulting Information with Objects__ (one week, starts 2016-09-25):
  For the fourth week of the course, we will be considering how and
  why we group information together.  Along the way, we will make some
  interesting animations involving multiple objects.
* __5 Arrays and Repetition__ (two weeks, starts 2016-10-02).  For the
  next two weeks of the course, we will consider another mechanisms for
  grouping information, mechanisms which allow us to make fairly complex
  works through the use of multiples.
* __6 Pixels and Filters__ (one week, starts 2016-10-16).  For this
  week, we will look in detail at the individual dots (pixels) that
  make up most computer images and consider how to write programs
  that transform existing images.
* __7 Interactivity__ (one week, starts 2016-10-23).  For this week,
  we will look at the features in processing that allow you to create
  works that user can interact with.   (Grinnell Fall break is the week
  of 23 October.  GOA Fall break is the week of 30 October.  You'll choose
  which of those two weeks to work.)
* __8 Argumentative Art__ (one week, starts 2016-11-06).  For this
  week, we will look at data visiualization and infographics.  You will 
  apply what you've learned so far to create a work that affects how
  someone thinks about a social or political issue.  
* __9 Additional Explorations__ (two weeks, starts 2016-11-13).  At this
  point, you'll know enough Processing to start choosing which additional
  topics you will find useful for your own purposes.  You can choose between
  modules on fractals, artificial life, three-dimensional work, and more.
* __10 Final Project__ (two weeks, starts 2016-11-27).  We move into the
  final phases of the course in the normal way, by allowing you to 
  apply the techniques that you've learned throughout the semester to
  a project of your own choice.  You may choose to do final projects
  individually, in pairs, or in larger groups.
* __11 Portfolio__ (one week, starts 2016-12-11).  For the final week of
  the course, you will tie together the various themes of the course,
  creating a portfolio of different kinds of work (not just artwork,
  but critiques, postings, essays, and such).

The Arc of a Module
-------------------

I have tried to design each module so that it follows a natural "arc".

* **Phase 1: Getting Started**:
  For the first few days of each module, you will learn a new technique
  (mostly through exercises), identify works that use the technique or that
  might otherwise inspire us, and do a short reading.  
  This initial work will be due on *Wednesday*.  
* **Phase 2: Applying Knowledge and Other Extensions**:
  For the next few days of each module, you will usually
  create something based on what you learned in the first part of the module.
  There will also usually be some other work.  This work will generally
  be due on *Sunday*.  
* **Phase 3: Critique**:
  Since I think you learn by looking closely at the work of others, 
  and that you learn from what others say about your own work, I will ask
  each of you to do a few critiques of peer work, which are due on *Tuesday*.
  Responses to those critiques will be due on *Wednesday*.

Two-week modules will vary this arc slightly.

Note that we will usually start the next module (or the next part of a
two-week module) during the critique period.  So, while you are critiquing
one set of work, you will be learning the techniques in the next module.

Policies
--------

This is a four-credit college class.  The US government dictates
that such courses have approximately twelve hours of work each week.
I generally try to design courses that take about 10-12 hours each
week, including in-class time.  I believe that GOA advertises this
as 8-10 hours each week.  So we'll probably aim for 10 as the
compromise goal.  I will check in with you regularly to see how
things are going, and adapt as appropriate.

Students are entering this course with a wide variety of artistic
and computational skills.  In general, I will grade works using
individual metrics, rather than comparing your works to each other.
My primary question will be whether you have achieved your vision
for the work (and whether you have a deep enough vision).  Some of
you will generally create works through borrowing and adaptation.
Some will create works "from scratch", as it were.  Both are
acceptable approaches.

As you can see from the syllabus, there are many kinds of work for this
course.  I try to use straightforward grading rubrics for most work.

I expect you to get work done by due dates.  However, I also know that
you have many other things that you are doing.  If you don't think you
can get work done on time, please send me a short explanation.

In many ways, what you get out of this course will depend on what
you put into it.  (How many teachers have told you that?  Probably
all of them.)  I expect you to engage in the course actively (and,
preferably, daily)
