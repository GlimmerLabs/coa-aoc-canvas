Project Proposals
=================

_This is a *Write* assignment.  You are expected to write an extended
(four or more paragraph) essay on the given topic._

_In grading these assignments, I tend to look at the thoughtfulness with
which you address the topic, the correctness of your presentation, and the
style of your presentation._

For the final two weeks of the class, you will be working on a
"Final Project".  You are now at a point in which you should be
able to tie together the various issues we've covered this semester.
And, at this point, I don't think I should be telling you what to
do, other than "Use Processing".

In addition, to help guide you through the project, I am going to
ask you to complete a number of milestones.  This assignment is the
first milestone, a project proposal.

Describe what you would like to do for the final project.  You
should discuss the intent of your work, the intended form of your
work, the Processing tools that will support your work, the other
projects you may draw upon in your work, and so on and so forth.  
You will likely find it useful to include some images in your 
description.

Note: Please post all aspects of your final project to this Discussion,
as followups to your original proposal.
