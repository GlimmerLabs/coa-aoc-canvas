_This is an **Uncategorized** assignment._

---

We have been exploring a variety of issues in this class, most
recently including the use of arrays and repetition.  For this week,
you will be choosing an existing artwork (preferably by a known
artist) that involves some form of repetition and writing a program
to build variants of that work.  In effect, you will be exploring one
form of the "Radical Bricolage" that Clayton describes for us.

You will do the project in two phases.  In the first phase (this assignment), 
you will choose a work and sketch the key features of the work.  In the
second phase (due Sunday) you will reproduce the work computationally and
also create variants.  In that second phase, you will also reflect on what,
if anything, you learned about the original work in doing this repetition.

For this phase of the work, you should do three things.

1. Find a work that involves repetition that you would like to reproduce
and vary.  If you are having trouble finding starting points, you could
refer back to the Clayton article or look at some works by Kandinsky.

2. Make a sketch of the key components of the work.

3. Write a post that includes (a) a picture of the work; (b) an explanation of
why you chose that work; (c) a description of the primary components of the
work (shape, position, etc.); (d) at least two sketches you have made; and
(e) a description of what you might vary in the work.
