About Find, Comment, Respond
============================

_This is a *Find, Comment, Respond* assignment.  In these assignments,
you typically find a work or works that meet a criteria, write a short 
piece in this discussion page commenting on those works (often guided 
by a prompt), and then respond to a specified number of your
colleagues' comments.  When choosing which comments to respond to,
you should generally try to find the reflections with fewer responses._

_In grading these of assignments, I tend to look for the seriousness
of your comments and responses._
