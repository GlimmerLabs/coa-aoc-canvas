Remix a Processing Work
=======================

^_make-instructions.html^

In this work, your goal is to create a new work from an existing work.

1. Pick one of the "interesting" processing works you or your peers
identified in exercise 1.1.4.  Then "Remix" the work by changing
values or procedure calls (e.g., you might make ellipses instead
of rectangles, or vice versa).  Do your best to make your remix not
only reflect the original work, but also be something different and
new.

2. Post both the original and your remixed work to this discussion
board.  In your post, describe what your goals were for the work,
summarize what you changed in the original, and indciate what effects
your changes had.
