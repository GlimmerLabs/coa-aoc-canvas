Find, Comment, Respond: Interactive Works
=========================================

^_find-comment-respond-instructions.html^

This week, we are exploring some simple uses of interactivity in digital
works.  As you build your own interactive works, you should also consider
how others incorporate interactivity into their pieces.

1. Find three *dissimilar* interactive works that you consider
particularly interesting or compelling.

2. For each work, create a short post that includes 

    * a link to the work,
    * a description of the work, 
    * an explanation of the role interactivity plays in the work, and 
    * a summary of what you find interesting or compelling about the work.

3. Pick six of your colleagues' posts or responses and respond to them.  You
might compare the work to something else, propose an alternative explanation,
identify other interesting aspects of the work, or anything else that you feel
moves our discussion forward.
