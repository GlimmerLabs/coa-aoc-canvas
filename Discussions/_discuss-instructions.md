About Discuss
=============

_This is a *Discuss* assignment.  In these assignments, you and your
peers will use our discussion board to consider some issues in depth.
I will provide a prompt to get the discussion started, but you and your
peers are expected to bring the discussion forward.  To be successful,
you will post comments that suggest that you have not only reflected on
the ideas that ground the discussion, but also that you have read and
considered your peers' comments.  I expect that there will be multiple
"threads" of discussion in each discussion assignment._

_In grading these assignments, I tend to look for the thoughtfulness of
your answers, although I may also consider some concrete issues, such as
number of original posts and number of followup comments._
