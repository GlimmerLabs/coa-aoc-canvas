Processing Filter
=================

^_make-instructions.html^

My colleague in studio art, Matt Kluber, says "Any new Photoshop filter is
old hat within a week of being released."  One of the powers of being able
to program is to be able to design new filters.  

Design and write your own non-trivial image filter in Processing.  Post
the following:

1. An explanation of the goals/purpose of the filter.

2. The Processing code for your filter.

3. Three works in which you use the filter.  (Post the images, not the code.)
