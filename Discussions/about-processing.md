Watch, Reflect, Respond
=======================

^_watch-reflect-respond-instructions.html^

1. Watch the first few minutes of the first video in the "Hello
Processing" tutorial, available at <http://hello.processing.org/editor/>.
(No, you can't just tell me how many times Dan Shiffman waves his
hands.)

2. In the discussion board, post a quick reflection on that video.  (Yes,
this prompt is intentionally open-ended.)

3. Post three *quick* responses to your colleagues' reflections.  A sentence
or two is fine for this.
