Create Interactive Work
=======================

^_make-instructions.html^

Create an interactive work in Processing.  Your work should incorporate
the mouse position (you can choose whether to continuously query
the mouse position, or only use the mouse position when someone
clicks on the work) and at least one keypress event.

Post an artist statement and the Processing code for your work.
