About Find and Analyze
======================

_This is a **Find and Analyze** assignment.  In these assignments,
you typically find a work or works that meet a criteria and then
analyze them, often computationally.  You will then post a link to
the work and your analysis to our discussion board._

_In grading these assignments, I tend to look for the seriousness
and correctness (when appropriate) of your analyses._
