About Make Assignments
======================

_This is a **Create** assignment.  In many ways, these assignments
reflect the projects typical in a studio class.  You've gained some
skills or learned a new technique.  It's now time to apply your new
knowledge to a project of your own design.  To help guide your work,
I will often place restrictions or requirements on what is appropriate
for the assignment._

_I tend to grade these assignments on how well you demonstrate the new
ideas we've covered, rather than on aesthetics._
