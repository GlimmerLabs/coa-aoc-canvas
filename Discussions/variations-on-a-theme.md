Create: Variations on a Theme
=============================

^_make-instructions.html^

In many of Warhol's works, such as the [Marilyn
Diptych](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/warhol-marilyn-diptych-t03093)
(1962), Warhol explored repetition of images with slight variations.  In
this project, you will use filters you and your peers created last week to
build your own composite image.

1. Pick an image that you feel compelling and that you consider appropriate
for reuse.  

2. Choose at least four different filters that you and your peers created
last week.

3. Create a Warhol-esque grid of the original image, applying a different
filter to each element in the grid.

4. Post the result, a description of the filters you applied, and an artist's
statement to the discussion board.
