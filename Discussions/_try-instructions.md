About Try Assignments
=====================

_This is a **Try** assignment.  In these assignments, you will generally
experiment with the Processing programming language.  First, you will
modify an existing program in some structured ways to discover certain
features of the program.  Next, you will answer some reflective questions
about your explorations.  You will further explore ideas through some more
open "play".  Finally, you will respond to some questions in the discussion
forum.  In some cases, you will also revise your work and post the 
revised work._

_In grading these assignments, I tend to look for the thoughtfulness of
your answers._
