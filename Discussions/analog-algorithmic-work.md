Analog Algorithmic Work
=======================

^_find-analyze-instructions.html^

1. Find an analog work (that is, an image of a physical work) whose
design is such that you could instruct others in how to make something
similar to it, preferably only with paper and colored pens or
pencils.  Do not choose any of the works from Clayson, and do not
choose something that is overly simple.

2. In your post, provide prose instructions that might allow someone to
replicate the work, or at least to make something similar.  Do not provide
a link to the original work.

3. Send me an email with a link to the original work so that I can 
compare your instructions to the work.
