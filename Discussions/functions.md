Functions in Processing
=======================

^_try-instructions.html^

1. Do the exercises that introduce functions at [link forthcoming].

2. Write a function, `smiley(x, y, width, height)` that
draws a smiley face of the specified width and height, centered at
(`x`,`y`).  Post the code for your function to the discussion board.
(If you read someone else's solution in writing your own, make sure to
cite them!)
