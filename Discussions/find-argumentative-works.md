Find, Comment, Respond: Argumentative Works
=========================================

^_find-comment-respond-instructions.html^

This week, we are exploring some ways of using digital art to convince others
of a viewpoint or to help otehrs explore an issue.  As you build your own 
argumentative works, you should also consider how others develop argumentative
pieces.

1. Find an infographic (still, interactive, or animated) that you consider
particularly effective.  Post a link to the work along with an explanation
as to why you consider the work effective.

2. Find an argumentative work on a similar topic that might be
considered more clearly in the "artistic" domain than an infographic.
Post a link to the work along with an explanation of what you consider
effective about the work.

3. Pick two infographics (other than your own) and suggest how they might
be made more "artistic" (whatever that means to you).

4. Pick two other argumentative works (other than your own) and suggest how
they might better incorporate "data" (whatever that means to you).
