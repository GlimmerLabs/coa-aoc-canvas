An Abbreviated Introduction to Processing
=========================================

^_try-instructions.html^

1. Follow the instructions at <https://globalonlineacademy.instructure.com/courses/514/pages/your-first-processing-programs>.

2. As those instructions suggest, you are learning a new language, which
means that you need to know vocabulary, grammar, semantics and more.
Post three things that you want to remember from these first experiments
with Processing.  (That is, things you expect to need to remember in
order to successfully write your next Processing program.)

*You may not repeat things other students have written.*
