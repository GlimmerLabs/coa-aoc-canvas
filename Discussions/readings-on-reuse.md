1. Pick *one* of these three cases and argue that the artist doing the
   copying (Sherrie Levine, Scott Blake, Jeff Koons) has, in fact, done
   original work.

2. Pick a different case and argue that the artist doing the copy has
   not created anything new.

3. Respond thoughtfully to three other posts.
