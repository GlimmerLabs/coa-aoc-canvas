Initial Processing Examples
===========================

^_find-comment-respond-instructions.html^

0. On the Web, find three processing sketches that you feel are 
compelling in some way.  You might look on <http://OpenProcessing.org> or 
<http://Processing.org> or <http://Sketchpad.cc>.  (You can look elsewhere,
too.  But these are good starting points.)

1. Post a link to each of the artworks in the discussion board.  Use
a separate post for each link.

2. Pick *two* of the works and explain, in your own words, the
general "algorithm" (process, strategy) that the artist has used
in the work.  For example, you might say "The artist has invisible
bouncing balls moving around the canvas and is drawing lines
connecting nearby balls."

3. Interrogate three of your colleagues' descriptions.  What is useful
about the description?  What is lacking?
