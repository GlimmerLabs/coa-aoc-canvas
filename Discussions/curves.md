1. Read the tutorial on curves at <https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/>.

2. Do the exercises on curves at [link forthcoming].

3. Post either (a) a comparison of the three primary kinds of curves
in Processing (arcs, splines, and Bezier curves); (b) an alternate
explanation of splines for someone who did not understand the original
reading; (c) an alternate explanation of Bezier curves for someone who
did not understand the original reading; or (d) two followup comments
to other posts on curves.
