Interacting Shapes
==================

^_make-instructions.html^

Now that we know about conditionals, we can start asking questions
about the shapes we draw.  For example, in our experiments with
conditionals, we saw that we can determine when a shape has reached
the edge of the screen and make it "bounce" in the other direction.

In this project, you will make an animated work in which two (or
more) shapes move around the screen and interact with each other.
The shapes will primarily interact when they touch.  You might
decide, for example, that if the two shapes touch, they bounce off
each other, or shange size, or change color.  You can also have the
shapes vary at other times, but there must be a clear interaction
when they touch.

1. Write and post a "goals" statement for this project.  What might
your work speak to?  What kinds of interactions might you do?

2. Sketch your work on paper and post one or more of your sketches.

3. Write and post a Processing program based on your goals and sketches.

4. Write and post a short artists' statement for your work.
