About Watch, Reflect, Respond Assignments
=========================================

_This is a **Watch, Reflect, Respond** assignment.  In these assignments,
you typically watch a video, write a short piece in this discussion page
reflecting on the video (often guided by a prompt), and then respond to
a specified number of your colleagues' reflections.  When choosing which
reflections to respond to, you should try to find the reflections with
fewer responses._

_In grading these of assignments, I tend to look for the seriousness
of your comments and responses._
