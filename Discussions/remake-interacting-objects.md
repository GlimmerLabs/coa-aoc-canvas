(Re)Make: Interacting Objects
=============================

^_make-instructions.html^

In a recent assignment, you created a program in which two (or more) shapes
interacted with each other.  Pick someone else's program and rewrite it to
use objects to clarify the behavior of the program.

1. Post your revised program.  

2. In a followup comment, explain why you chose that program to rewrite.

3. In another followup comment, indicate what aspects of the original
program made it easy to rewrite and what aspects made it harder to
rewrite.
