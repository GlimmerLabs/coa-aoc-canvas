Self Portrait
=============

^_make-instructions.html^

1. Write a processing sketch that makes a picture of you.  (That is, make
a "self portrait") in Processing.  Your sketch need not be cmplletely
realistic, but it should be something that you would be comfortable using
as an avatar online and that a friend would be likely to associate with you.

2. Post your sketch to this discussion.
