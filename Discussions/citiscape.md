Citiscape
=========

^_make-instructions.html^

1. Pick at least three of your classmates' instructions for making buildings
from assignment 2.2.1.  

2. Rewrite each of those sets of instructions, as well as your own, as
functions.  At minimum, you should include the coordinates of the position 
of the building as parameters.  However, you may also choose to add other
parameters (e.g., colors, size).

3. Using those four functions, make a simple citiscape.  Post your code
and an image to the discussion.
