Sketchboooks
============

Summary
-------

Each week, I expect you to regularly post "sketches" and comments
on each others' sketches.  Read [my notes on daily
sketches](../pages/daily-sketches) for full details.  For the first
week, you can post almost anything that shows that you are thinking
about the course: links to Web sites, notes about things you've
learned, etc.

Short instructions
------------------

* Post five sketches (code, screenshot, photo of physical sketch, notes,
  whatever).  You may not do all the posts on the same day; I should
  see postings on at least three separate days (I would prefer five
  days).  For visual or code sketches, add a few sentences to explain
  what you were thinking about or trying to achieve.
* Post ten responses to your colleagues' posts.  While some of the posts
  can be a short comment or compliment, at least two must show some
  depth.  Responses should also be posted on at least three separate
  days.
