Ownership (Analog Works, Citiscapes)
====================================

^_discuss-instructions.html^

You have now dealt with at least two situations in which "ownership" or
"authorship" of the work might be disputed.  

* For your algorithmic analog work, we have at least three artists
  involved: The original artist, the student who wrote the instructions,
  and the student who followed the instructions.
* For your citiscape, we also have at least three groups of artists involved: 
  The students who wrote the instructions for making the buildings, the 
  student who modified those instructions and used them to make a citiscape,
  and the computer, which followed those instructions.

Why is authorship (or ownership) important?  Most significantly,
because people care that their work is credited.  In addition, if
the works become commercially valuable (yes, you can stop laughing
now), one would need to settle who deserves proceeds.

1. Students A, B, and C must each write a post in which they argue that the
original artist should be considered the true "author" of the analog
algorithmic works.

2. Students D, E, and F must each write a post in which they argue that the 
student writing the instructions is the true "author" of the analog
algorithmic works.

3. Students G, H, and I must each write a post in which they argue that the
students who followed the instructions are the true "authors" of the
analog algorithmic works.

4. Students A, D, and G must each write a post in which they argue
that the students who wrote the instructions for making the individual
buildings are the true "authors" of the citiscape.

5. Students B, E, and H must each write a post in which they argue
that the student who rewrote those instructions is the true "author"
of the citiscape.

6. Students C, F, and I must each write a post in which they argue
that the computer is the true "author" of the citiscape.

7. All students must write at least three followup comments on other
students' posts.
