Open Projects, Week Four
========================

^_make-instructions.html^

You've now learned a variety of tools in Processing.  It's time to
apply those tools to a work of your choice.  Create a work in
Processing that speaks to an issue in your local area.  (Yes, those
instructions are intentionally left open and vague.)  The code for
your work must incorporate (a) conditionals, (b) images taken from
elsewhere, (c) objects, and (d) randomness.

Post your work, a screen shot, and an artist's statement.
