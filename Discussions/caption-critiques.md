Captioning Critiques
====================

You have spent the semester making video critiques, not least because I
asked you to do so, and because video is a normal component of GOA courses.
But you also have a responsibility to think about potential audiences.  
Video has two major flaws: It is partially inaccessible to both the visually
impaired and the auditorially impaired.

As you likely know, video authors often support those with auditory
impairments by *captioning* the videos.  You may not know that it is
also possible to add *narration* to videos in order to support the visually
impaired.

Pick one of the critiques you recorded this semester and add both captions
and narration using Able Player, available at 
<http://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/>.

Post your captioned video and your detailed transcript.

[Further details forthcoming.]
