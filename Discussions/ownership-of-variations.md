Ownership of Variations
=======================

^_discuss-instructions.html^

Earlier in this module, you created a work that applied at least four filters
to multiple copies of an existing work.  Once again, we have an instance in
which there are multiple "authors" involved in the work you have created: Not
only was your own creativity involved, but so was the creativity of the author
of the original work and the students who created the filters.

1. Write a short post in which you argue that the authors of the filters
should be considered the true owners of your work.  (Note that it is
probably counterproductive to argue that you don't own your own work.
Nonetheless, you are required to do so.)  You may not repeat any previously
posted arguments (so there's some advantage to doing this part of the
assignment early).

2. Post a counter argument to two other posts.  (You can counter an original
post, or you can counter a counter argument.)
