Find and Analyze: Photoshop or GIMP Filters
===========================================

^_find-analyze-instructions.html^

As you no doubt know, both Photoshop and GIMP provide a variety of
"filters" that transform images in interesting ways.  Pick two
non-trivial filters and, for each, describe what the filter does
and explain, to the best of your ability, how the filter achieves
its goal.  Your explanation should discuss how each pixel is
transformed.

Note that this assignment involves two posts, one for the first filter
and one for the second.
