Building
========

^_make-instructions.html^

1. Write a processing sketch that makes a picture of a building.  (It need
not be a real building.)  Strive for something with some visual impact;
please don't just channel the Bauhaus movement and make one vertical rectangle.

2. Post your sketch to this channel.
