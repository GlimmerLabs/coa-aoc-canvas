Make: Population Growth
=======================

^_make-instructions.html^

What will the world look like in 2050?  Will we have a larger population?  The
same population?  A smaller population?  What will the implications of those
changes in population be, and what other issues will the world face?

Create a work that reflects on likely population change and the impacts of
those changes on your community.  Your work should be something that you
could show to a local official to help persuade them of changes in policy 
they should make now to prepare for the future.  

You can choose whether to make the work still or animated, and interactive
or non-interactive.
